custom markdown files:
    add a premade markdown file:
        syntax: staticQuo.py page/post add [markdownFile] -> add premade markdown
        system asks if you want to add any other files [Y/N]
            Y: give all files you want to add, seperated by a comma
            N: end
        
    delete a page/post:
        syntax: staticQuo.py page/post del [filename]
        system asks if you want to delete any other files [Y/N]
            Y: give all files you want to delete, seperated by a comma
            N: end

prefabs:
    add x amount of sites using a certain template:
        syntax: staticQuo.py [template] add [number] post/page
            repeat [number] times:
                <prefab fill in>
    
    //everything above this point should work as intended
    //everything below this point has not yet been added in
    browse prefabs and choose one to edit (not scalable to multiple sites)
        syntax: staticQuo.py prefabs
            display list of prefabs, divided between posts and and pages
            user answers which one he wants to edit
            <prefab fill in>
    
    <prefab fill in>:
        ask each fillable individually
        display default tags
        ask if user wants to add any tags (if prefab is post) [Y/N]
            Y: loop tag adding until user says stop
            N: next step
        ask what to name the file (if filename already exists, notify user and try again) [continue/rename]
            continue: previous file gets overwritten
            rename: user gives new name
